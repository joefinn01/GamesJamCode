# GamesJamCode
This repository contains some examples of the code I created while I took part in a games jam with one of my course mates. The full project is featured on my portfolio and is called Happy Island.

The Hover over script is responsible for showing the happiness of each animal when it's hovered over.

The animal placement script is responsible for placing the animals in the scene. This works by using a raycast to draw a line from the cursor. A bool is then tested to see if it's a valid place to put the object.

The UI script was responsible for updating the amount of overall happiness the player has as well as displaying it in an appropriate format.
